# Pitonise

Scripts for divination using entropy generated by an adaptation of LavaRand.

## Diceware 

A lot of the oracles use a number of diceware-generated words. For these the
`diceware` module needs to be installed; it is not directly imported in the
files because for lots of them a custom dictionary is used which is not
available on PyPI.

## Usage

Generally, each folder contains two main scripts:

- `pitonise.py`: this script is generally different in each oracle, with
  different outputs and configuration of outputs (such as language and
  number of words for diceware); should be abstracted and have submodules /
  parameters to provide custom settings without duplicated code. Already
  contains the entropy generated by next script, so you can run only
  this one to get the same results.

- `lava.py`: used to generate random bytes from the image at `lava.jpg";
  name can be changed in file. Very experimental
  adaptation of an alpha implementation of LavaRand by
  [AnthonyBriggs](https://gist.github.com/AnthonyBriggs/8396607). When ran,
  reproduces the same random bytes already present in above script.

To run scripts that uses brazilian portuguese diceware words, it is needed
to download the source and add manually the pt-br wordlist. I used this one
(https://github.com/ulif/diceware/blob/master/diceware/wordlists/wordlist_pt-br.txt).
